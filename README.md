## Introduction
 
Datavania is an online database and API for Castlevania: Harmony of Despair. The data includes detailed information about items, item drop locations, monsters, characters, achievements, DLC, music and more.

While the information is mostly for the XBLA version of the game, most data should be accurate for the PSN version of the game as well, containing detailed information about items and drop location, monsters, characters with popular character builds and other things like achievements, DLC and music.
                                                                              
This project originally started out as an idea to harvest and store item drop data from chests in a searchable database for reference purposes, but was later expanded (and rewritten) during development to include more aspects of the game.
